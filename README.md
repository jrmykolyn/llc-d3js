## Description

### Why Learn D3JS?
In a world where there is more data than most of us really know what to do with, how do we go about displaying facts in a clear and visually engaging way? D3Js is a JavaScript library that helps bring data to life using HTML, CSS, and SVGs.

D3JS allows us to take big data and make it beautiful and meaningful through data visualization. It’s also great for beginners, as it has a lot of libraries (like c3js.org) that provide pre-designed charts that can be easily customized.

What will you learn at this workshop?
In this workshop, we’ll use our knowledge of JavaScript to work with the D3 library. We’ll explore the anatomy of SVGs (scalable vector graphics) and how they can be leveraged programmatically. Learners will use their knowledge to create data visualizations like scatterplots, and make them interactive, for users to engage with and enjoy.

Specifically, we will cover the following:
* An overview of D3JS, why it's cool, and how you can use it in the workplace
* How to create SVGs with code
* How to grab data from the .csv file and visually display it using geometrical shapes
* How to integrate basic user interaction in order to navigate around your data (and be able to see some cool animations!)
* Coding in RGB colour, and the importance of colour in data visualizations

### Prerequisites
“JavaScript for Beginners: An Introduction to The Fundamentals of Web Programming”  or the equivalent amount of JavaScript knowledge, including familiarity working with arrays, objects, and loops.
